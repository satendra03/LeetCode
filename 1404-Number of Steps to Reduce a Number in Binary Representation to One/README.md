# Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One

## Description

Given a binary string `s` representing a positive integer, return the number of steps to reduce the number to `1` under the following operations:

1. If the number is even, divide it by 2.
2. If the number is odd, add 1 to it.

## Approach

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `count` to track the number of steps.
   - `carry` to manage the carry during the addition when the current bit is 1.
2. **Iterate from the End**:
   - Traverse the string `s` from the last character to the second character.
   - For each bit, calculate the `currentBit` by adding the carry.
   - If `currentBit` is 1, increment `carry` and increase `count` by 2.
   - If `currentBit` is 0, increase `count` by 1.
3. **Final Steps**:
   - After the loop, add the carry to the `count`.

## How to Use

1. **Compile**: `g++ -o reduce_binary_to_one reduce_binary_to_one.cpp`
2. **Run**: `./reduce_binary_to_one`
