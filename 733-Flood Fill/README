# Number of Provinces

## Description

You are given an image represented by an `m x n` grid of integers `image`, where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image. You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `color`. Your task is to perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a flood fill:

Begin with the starting pixel and change its color to `color`.
Perform the same process for each pixel that is directly adjacent (pixels that share a side with the original pixel, either horizontally or vertically) and shares the same color as the starting pixel.
Keep repeating this process by checking neighboring pixels of the updated pixels and modifying their color if it matches the original color of the starting pixel.
The process stops when there are no more adjacent pixels of the original color to update.
Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

## Approach

1. **Check for Early Exit**:
   - If the starting pixel `image[sr][sc]` already has the target `color`, return the `image` as no changes are needed.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Store the color of the starting pixel in `toChange` for comparison.
   - Define direction vectors `dx` and `dy` to move up, right, down, and left.
   - Create a `visited` matrix to track which pixels have been processed.

3. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use a queue to process all connected pixels with the same initial color.
   - Push the starting pixel into the queue.
   - For each pixel dequeued:
     - If it hasn't been visited, mark it as visited and change its color.
     - Explore its 4 neighbors using the direction vectors:
       - If a neighbor is within bounds, has not been visited, and has the same color as `toChange`, add it to the queue.

4. **Return Result**:
   - After processing all connected pixels, return the updated `image`.


## How to Use

1. **Compile**: `g++ -o solution solution.cpp`
2. **Run**: `./solution`
