## Introduction üìò

LeetCode is an excellent resource for sharpening your coding skills and preparing for technical interviews. This repository is organized by problem number and name, and each solution includes explanations and comments where applicable. My goal is to provide clear and concise solutions to help others understand different approaches to solving these problems.

## Directory Structure üìÇ

The repository is structured as follows:


- Each problem is stored in a directory named with the problem number and title.
- Each problem directory contains:
  - The solution file (e.g., `solution.cpp`)
  - A `README.md` file with a detailed explanation of the problem and the solution

## Solution Format üìù

Each solution is provided in a separate file and follows this format:

- **Filename:** `solution.cpp`
- **Docstring:** A brief description of the problem
- **Code:** The C++ code solving the problem
- **Comments:** Inline comments explaining key parts of the solution

Additionally, each problem directory includes a `README.md` file with:

- A restatement of the problem
- Explanation of the approach and logic used in the solution
- Time and space complexity analysis

## How to Use üîß

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/satendra03/LeetCode.git
    cd LeetCode
    ```

2. **Navigate to the solution of interest:**

    ```bash
    cd solutions/0001 - Two Sum
    ```

3. **Compile and run the solution:**

    Each solution can be compiled and run using a C++ compiler. For example:

    ```bash
    g++ solution.cpp -o solution
    ./solution
    ```

## Contributing ü§ù

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature-branch`)
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add new solution or improve existing one'`)
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature-branch`)
5. Create a new Pull Request
